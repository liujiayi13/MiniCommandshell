It's a project as a command shell

Just type ```Run ./myShell``` to start running this program.

You can use many operations the same as Linux shell such as ls, cd, set and so on.

For detail about the operations available, please look at TESTING.txt.
I list many operations that I use for testing. 

Just type ctrl+C to exit.

Thank you for your time!
